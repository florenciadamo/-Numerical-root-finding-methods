# Numerical root-finding methods
Most numerical root-finding methods use iteration, producing a sequence of numbers that hopefully converge towards the root as a limit. They require one or more initial guesses of the root as starting values, then each iteration of the algorithm produces a successively more accurate approximation to the root.
These algorithms were created using the Burden-Faires book as a basis.
